## Command-Line Email Client

## Features
- Manage recipients (official, office friend, personal).
- Send birthday greetings.
- Store emails as objects.
- List recipients with birthdays.
- View sent emails.
- Count recipients.

When the email client is running, an object for each email recipient should be maintained in the application. For this, you will have to load the recipient details from the text file into the application. For each recipient having a birthday, a birthday greeting should be sent on the correct day. Official friends and personal recipients should be sent different messages (e.g. Wish you a Happy Birthday. <your name> for an office friend, and hugs and love on your birthday. <your name> for personal recipients). But all personal recipients receive the same message, and all office friends should receive the same message.  A list of recipients to whom a birthday greeting should be sent is maintained in the application, when it is running. When the email client is started, it should traverse this list, and send a greeting email to anyone having their birthday on that day.
